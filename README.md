# RoboCupSoccerSim

This project is a MATLAB simulation designed to model RoboCup SPL matches. It's primary function is to allow testing of various player behaviors in a controlled environment. It is also designed to be easily able to intigrate into a behavioral reinforcement learning method.

##Requirements
MATLAB (written and tested in R2016a but *should* be compatable with any recent release)

Parallel Computing Toolbox if you want to run simulations in parallel

A reasonably recent computer if you want to run the simulation in realtime (or faster)
